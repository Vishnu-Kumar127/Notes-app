# Notes App

A simple, user-friendly Notes app built with **React.js** for the front-end and **Django** for the back-end. This project allows users to create, edit, and delete notes with ease.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Add new notes with a title and description.
- **Edit Notes**: Update existing notes at any time.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes when they are no longer needed.
- **User Authentication**: Register and log in to manage your personal notes securely.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Technologies Used

### Front-end:
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **React Router**: For handling routes in the app.

### Back-end:
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for developing the backend API.
- **Django REST Framework**: For building RESTful APIs in Django.

### Database:
- **SQLite** (default in Django, but easily switchable to other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL).
